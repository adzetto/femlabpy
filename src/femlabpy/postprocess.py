"""
Small post-processing helpers for assembled FEM results.

Workflow role
-------------
This module currently focuses on one task: extracting support reactions from
the global internal-force vector once the solution is complete. Keeping that
logic isolated makes the MATLAB-compatible return tables easier to test and
reuse across the static, nonlinear, and legacy wrapper workflows.

def reaction(q, C, dof: int, comp: int | None = None):
    """
    Extract support reactions at constrained degrees of freedom.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q:
        Global internal-force vector.
    C:
        Legacy boundary-condition table ``[node, local_dof, value]``.
    dof:
        Degrees of freedom per node.
    comp:
        Optional one-based component selector. When supplied, only the matching
        constraint rows are returned and the first column stores the filtered
        constraint-row number, reproducing MATLAB's ``reaction(..., comp)``
        behavior.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Reaction table with either ``[node, local_dof, reaction]`` columns or
        ``[constraint_row, reaction]`` when ``comp`` is supplied.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    Extracts the support reactions from the computed global internal force vector
    at the constrained degrees of freedom.

    Mathematical Formulation
    ------------------------
    The reactions are calculated using $R = K u - P$.
