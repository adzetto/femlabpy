"""
Damping-matrix builders for structural dynamics.

Workflow role
-------------
This module converts modal targets into an explicit damping matrix after the
mass and stiffness matrices are available. It is usually read together with
``femlabpy.modal`` and ``femlabpy.dynamics`` because those modules supply the
frequencies, mode shapes, and time integrators that consume the damping model.

Public entry points
-------------------
- ``rayleigh_coefficients`` fits the two proportional damping constants from
  two target frequencies and damping ratios.
- ``rayleigh_damping`` assembles the physical damping matrix from ``M`` and
  ``K``.
- ``modal_damping`` builds a dense damping matrix from explicit modal targets
  for reduced or teaching-scale problems.

    """
    Compute Rayleigh damping mass and stiffness proportional multipliers.

    Rayleigh damping constructs the damping matrix as a linear combination
    of the mass and stiffness matrices, ``C = alpha * M + beta * K``.

    This function computes the coefficients `alpha` and `beta` such that
    the specified modal damping ratios (`zeta1`, `zeta2`) are achieved at
    the given circular natural frequencies (`omega1`, `omega2`).

    Mathematical Formulation
    ------------------------
    The modal damping ratio for a mode with circular frequency ``omega_n`` is
    ``zeta_n = alpha / (2 * omega_n) + beta * omega_n / 2``.

    Given two frequencies and desired damping ratios, this forms a 2x2 linear system.
    Solving this system yields the exact mass and stiffness multipliers needed to
    anchor the damping curve. Note that frequencies between omega1 and omega2 will
    have slightly less damping than the target, and frequencies outside this range
    will have significantly higher damping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    omega1, omega2 : float
        Two target circular natural frequencies (rad/s). If you have frequencies
        in Hz, multiply by 2*pi before passing them to this function.
    zeta1, zeta2 : float
        Desired critical damping ratios at those frequencies (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).

    Returns
    -------
    alpha : float
        Mass-proportional coefficient (s^-1).
    beta : float
        Stiffness-proportional coefficient (s).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Compute coefficients for 5% damping at 10 rad/s and 50 rad/s
    >>> alpha, beta = rayleigh_coefficients(10.0, 50.0, 0.05, 0.05)

def rayleigh_damping(M, K, alpha: float, beta: float):
    """
    Build the Rayleigh (proportional) damping matrix C = alpha*M + beta*K.

    This formulation creates a classical damping matrix that preserves the
    normal modes of the undamped system. Because it is a linear combination
    of the mass and stiffness matrices, the resulting damping matrix `C`
    will automatically inherit their sparsity patterns, making it highly
    efficient for implicit time-history analysis using direct solvers.

    Mathematical Formulation
    ------------------------
    ``C = alpha * M + beta * K``

    The damping ratio for a mode with circular frequency ``omega_n`` is
    ``zeta_n = alpha / (2 * omega_n) + beta * omega_n / 2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : ndarray or scipy.sparse matrix, shape (ndof, ndof)
        Global mass matrix of the structure.
    K : ndarray or scipy.sparse matrix, shape (ndof, ndof)
        Global stiffness matrix of the structure.
    alpha : float
        Mass-proportional damping multiplier (s^-1). Controls damping at
        low frequencies.
    beta : float
        Stiffness-proportional damping multiplier (s). Controls numerical
        damping at high frequencies.

    Returns
    -------
    C : ndarray or scipy.sparse.lil_matrix, shape (ndof, ndof)
        The explicit global damping matrix. If either `M` or `K` is sparse,
        the returned `C` will be a sparse LIL matrix suitable for assembly
        or conversion to CSR/CSC formats.

    Examples
    --------

def modal_damping(M, omega, phi, zeta):
    """
    Construct a dense Caughey damping matrix from explicit modal damping ratios.

    Unlike Rayleigh damping which only fits two points, modal damping allows
    you to specify the exact critical damping ratio for an arbitrary number of
    individual modes. The resulting matrix will preserve the classical normal
    modes of the system.

    Mathematical Formulation
    ------------------------
    Using the orthogonality of mass-normalized mode shapes (Phi^T M Phi = I),
    the modal damping matrix can be constructed directly in physical space as:

        C = M * Phi * diag(2 * zeta_i * omega_i) * Phi^T * M

    Note: This explicitly constructs a fully dense matrix, which is highly
    inefficient for large FEM models. It is typically used only for reduced
    systems or theoretical validation on small degrees-of-freedom problems.
    For large systems, use `rayleigh_damping` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : ndarray, shape (ndof, ndof)
        Global mass matrix (dense).
    omega : array_like, shape (n_modes,)
        Natural circular frequencies (rad/s) for each mode.
    phi : ndarray, shape (ndof, n_modes)
        Mass-normalized mode shape matrix (eigenvectors).
        Must satisfy phi^T @ M @ phi = I.
    zeta : array_like, shape (n_modes,)
        Target critical damping ratios for each individual mode.

    Returns
